# 📝 Handling Forms Using Controlled Components (React)

---

## 🎯 Aim

To create and handle forms in a frontend application using **Controlled Components in React**.

---

## 🛠️ Software Requirements

* Node.js
* React
* VS Code
* Web Browser

## 📖 Theory

Controlled components are React components in which form data is handled by the component’s state using the **useState** hook.

In controlled components:

* Form input values are stored inside the component state.
* Every change is handled using the **onChange** event.
* The form is submitted using an event handler.
* React has full control over user input.

### Advantages:

* Better validation
* Predictable behavior
* Centralized data handling
